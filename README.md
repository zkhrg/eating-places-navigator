# Go Bootcamp Project - Day 03

This project was developed as part of the Go Bootcamp, focusing on creating a simple API with data loading and basic interface implementation.

## Overview

This project includes:

- **Data Loading:** A module that handles the loading of initial data required by the API.
- **Simple Interface:** A basic implementation of Go interfaces.
- **Complete API:** A fully functional REST API built with Go.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Clean and modular code organization following best practices.
- **Dockerized:** Easily deployable using Docker. Simply run `docker-compose up` to start the application.
- **RESTful API:** Implements a basic but fully functional REST API with standard HTTP methods.

## Getting Started
